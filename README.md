Home Manager using Nix w/ Podman Support
========================================

If you don't know what this is I wouldn't suggest using it. 

Simple merge of upstream and [n-hass's podman module](https://github.com/n-hass/home-manager/tree/podman-module) from a pull request in nix-community/home-manager.
